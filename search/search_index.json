All APIs are accessed over HTTPS at https://api.enclave.io , and generally follow 'standard' REST patterns. We use the following HTTP Methods: Method Usage GET Retrieve existing data. GET calls are idempotent (no data is ever modified by a GET request). POST Create a new entity in your organisation. In most cases, returns the created entity. PATCH Modify an existing entity in your organisation. Returns the entity after any modifications. PUT Mutate the state of one or more entities (e.g. enable, disable) DELETE Remove one or more entities from your organisation Swagger/OpenAPI We provide a complete Swagger/OpenAPI definition file at https://api.enclave.io/swagger/v1/swagger.json ; you can use your favourite OpenAPI code generator (such as swagger-codegen ) to create a client in your preferred language. The root URL of our API server ( https://api.enclave.io/ ) hosts a basic Swagger UI that you can use to view all our endpoints, and test them out. Authentication There are almost no unauthenticated APIs in Enclave's REST API; in most cases, you will need to authenticate with our APIs. Authentication is achieved through the use of a Personal Access Token , that is passed as a standard oauth Authorisation: Bearer token in the header. You can create access tokens in your account page in the portal . These tokens are 63-character alpha-numeric strings, and are secrets that should be protected in the same way as other network secrets you possess. Created tokens currently have access to all of the Enclave organisations that your account has access to in the portal. In future we will allow tokens to be restricted to a specific organisation; get in touch on our community channels if this is something you need. As an example, you can use curl to authenticate (and get the list of organisations you have access to): $ curl --oauth2-bearer <token> https://api.enclave.io/account/orgs { \"orgs\" : [ { \"orgId\" : \"xxxxxxxxxx\" , \"orgName\" : \"Demo Organisation\" , \"role\" : \"Owner\" } ] } In subsequent examples we're going to use $token in place of a full token. On linux, you can create this variable in your terminal: $ token=<token> Organisation ID Most of the operations you will want to perform against the Enclave API will happen in the context of an organisation . All the entities you can manipulate via the API are attached to an organisation, so you will need to pass an Organisation ID to these APIs. The ID of your organisation can be found in the settings page , but can also be found in the portal URL (e.g. https://portal.enclave.io/org/<orgId>/systems ). Organisation IDs are not secret, and can freely be shared. Only users with access to that organisation will be able to invoke APIs against it. Here's an example of getting the list of systems in your organisation: $ curl --oauth2-bearer $token https://api.enclave.io/org/<orgId>/systems { \"metadata\" : { \"total\" : 1 , \"firstPage\" : 0 , \"prevPage\" : null, \"lastPage\" : 0 , \"nextPage\" : null } , \"links\" : { \"first\" : \"https://api.enclave.io/org/<orgId>/systems\" , \"prev\" : null, \"next\" : null, \"last\" : \"https://api.enclave.io/org/<orgId>/systems\" } , \"items\" : [ { \"systemId\" : \"ABC\" , \"description\" : \"John's Laptop\" , \"state\" : \"Connected\" , \"customDns\" : [] , \"lastSeen\" : \"2021-03-31T11:31:44.3846701Z\" , \"enrolledAt\" : \"2021-03-31T10:55:41.291Z\" , \"enrolmentKeyId\" : 1 , \"enrolmentKeyDescription\" : \"Workstations\" , \"isEnabled\" : true, \"connectedFrom\" : \"X.X.X.X\" , \"hostname\" : \"JOHN-LAPTOP\" , \"platformType\" : \"Windows\" , \"osVersion\" : \"Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (10.0.19041)\" , \"enclaveVersion\" : \"2021.3.24.0\" , \"tags\" : [ { \"tag\" : \"quickstart\" } ] } ] } In subsequent examples, we'll refer to our organisation ID with $orgId , much as we did with $token . Parameters For GET requests, all additional parameters not already specified in the URL can be passed as query string parameters: $ curl --oauth2-bearer $token https://api.enclave.io/org/ $orgId /systems?search = Jane In this example, we're adding the additional search parameter to filter the retrieved list is passed in the query string. For POST , PATCH , PUT and DELETE requests, parameters not included in the URL should be provided as JSON in the request body, with a Content-Type of application/json . $ curl --oauth2-bearer $token \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{\"description\": \"My New Key\"}' \\ https://api.enclave.io/org/ $orgId /enrolment-keys The above example creates a new Enrolment Key called \"My New Key\", and returns the created key. Timestamps All date/time values returned from our API are formatted in ISO8601 format (e.g. 2021-03-31T11:31:44.3846701Z ), and always in the UTC timezone. User-Agent Header All requests to the Enclave API must provide a User-Agent header (your requests will fail without one). We ask that you specify a User-Agent describing your application, to help identify it. Here's an example with curl: $ curl -A \"my-app-integration\" --oauth2-bearer $token https://api.enclave.io/org/ $orgId /systems?search = Jane API Errors Errors from the API are returned using the standard Problem Details format ( RFC 7807 ).

The Enclave Network Fabric quickly and easily builds secure, private and direct connections to other systems also running the Enclave Network Fabric software. Enclave does this by creating virtual network interfaces on each operating system where it is installed, allowing applications transparently bind to and use the Enclave virtual network to seamlessly communicate with each other as if they were on the same local area network. Enclave builds connectivity at OSI layer 2, encapsulating any protocols which sit above Ethernet frames, so in addition to carrying IP traffic, Enclave can also carry typically non-routed protocols, like NetBIOS and Multicast. Connectivity pathways constructed by Enclave do not require firewall ports to be opened and usually does not require changes to your existing infrastructure or network topology to function. To achieve peer-to-peer connectivity without ingress traffic explicitly allowed through the firewall/perimeter/network edge of either endpoint, Enclave Network Fabric software both relies on and communicates with several key services: identity and access control, policy enforcement and peer discovery - all delivered by our SaaS platform. Endpoint Identities Each system, endpoint, device or container enrolled to and running Enclave holds a digital certificate with a globally unique name. Certificates are assigned transparently to endpoints as they are licensed by the end-user. Each endpoint generates, encrypts and locally stores its private key, which never leaves that system. A globally unique digital certificate is issued to each endpoint by our SaaS platform which allows that endpoint to cryptographically attest to its identity. Mutual Intent Endpoints running Enclave only learn of each other\u2019s existence once mutual intent from both parties has been cryptographically established. Prior to this, entities have no knowledge of one another. This is a key concept in which gives rise to authenticate-before-connect connectivity, which serves to effectively cloak systems running Enclave from third party discovery, observation, targeting and attack. Connection Establishment Summary Once mutual intent is confirmed, Enclave builds a Direct Client-to-Client connection (DCC) as opposed to traditional Client-Server connectivity between cooperating entities. The following diagram illustrates the sequence of events by which two or more systems establish mutually authenticated, peer-to-peer connectivity with Enclave. Endpoints are only introduced to one another when mutual intent is demonstrated by both parties, and connections terminate if either party decides to disconnect, or their certificate expires. Note: The control channel relies on our Cloud services to help facilitate and introduce cooperating endpoints, but each data channel is negotiated and authenticated directly between cooperating endpoints with end-to-end encryption \u2014 without the involvement of the Enclave Cloud infrastructure. Part 1: UDP and TCP hole punching UDP and TCP hole punching are commonly used techniques in peer-to-peer networking applications on the Internet involving hosts connecting to each other which reside in discreet and isolated private networks. Both hosts attempting to communicate (from behind NAT devices and closed firewalls) will start sending connection attempts or data to each other, using outbound traffic only and multiple attempts. The first packet received from the other host will be dropped, its firewall was closed and the network address translation table considered the traffic unsolicited. However, after that same firewall and NAT has a record of having sent a packet back to the other machine, it will allow any subsequent packets originating from the sender's address and port number as expected and solicited return traffic. Stated simply, both systems will attempt to communicate with one another simultaneously multiple times. The first a system receives will be dropped, but after that same system has sent data to the other host, any further data originating from that host will be allowed to traverse the firewall and NAT. The Enclave Discovery Service resides on the public Internet and is used to help connecting peers gain knowledge of, and then share with one another their respective public and private IP address information and source port numbers. This gives Enclave peers enough information to attempt UDP/TCP hole punching Direct Client-to-Client bi-directional connections using outbound-only traffic from their inside of their respective private networks, without infrastructure changes or opening the firewall. This technique is also widely used in many other types of peer-to-peer software including VoIP telephony and WebRTC. Security note: Local RFC 1918 IP address information is shared with the Discovery Service, which is in turn shared with cooperating parties with whom you are trying to establish direct, private network connectivity. In the context of WebRTC, sharing of private IP addresses via the client's browser is considered to be undesirable information disclosure as it allows websites to conduct covert reconnaissance and surveillance. Enclave is different. The principle of mutual intent requires cooperation and authentication before a connection is possible, so disclosure of private IP addresses is limited with Enclave to scenarios where Enclave is simply extending an existing real-world agreement to cooperate, as such disclosure of private IP addresses is not considered to be a security concern in this context. Part 2: Mutual Authentication After a bi-directional TCP/UDP connection has been established, it is important to remember that at this point that data channel is unauthenticated, and unencrypted. The connected parties transition the connection to a trusted state without outside assistance, support or communication from other parties. Prior to connection establishment, both systems had expressed intent to communicate with one another based on knowledge of the other system's certificate name. As each system holds its own certificate, and corresponding private key the pair have all the information they need to perform a standard authenticated key exchange. Both parties share their certificates with one another, and the recipient checks the name on the certificate matches an expected connection, and checks the validity of the received certificate. If the certificate is expected and valid, the sender is asked to sign a unique challenge to demonstrate knowledge of their private key to authenticate the connection. This is a mutual action, and both sides must attest knowledge of their private keys. Once the certificate are confirmed to be authentic, the party has gained knowledge of their peer's public key from the exchanged digital certificate. Authenticated knowledge of partner public key is used to compute the encryption keys for the connection. Part 3: End-to-end Encryption All cryptographic features and capabilities in Enclave are implemented with libsodium . Using shared knowledge of each other\u2019s public keys, the two parties can securely compute a set of shared keys using their peer's public key and their own private key. Enclave uses Ed25519 for digital signatures and Curve25519 for ephemeral key exchange and perfect forward secrecy. Algorithm details: rx || tx = BLAKE2B-512(p.n || client_pk || server_pk) One a set of share keys are computed, the rx and tx keys seed a symmetric cipher used to encrypt data before it is placed on the wire. If the processor supports hardware-accelerated AES using Intel SSSE3 extensions and aesni and pclmul instructions then Enclave will prefer the AES256-GCM cipher. Intel Westmere processors (introduced in 2010) and newer meet the requirements, and major cloud vendors (Azure, AWS, DigitalOcean) support these processor features sets across their entire fleet of instance types. For endpoints which are not capable of hardware-accelerated cryptography, Enclave will use ChaCha20-Poly1305 (ChaCha20 stream cipher and Poly1305 authentication MAC). Both ciphers are authenticated encryption schemes (AEAD ciphers) which can recognise improperly-constructed ciphertexts and refuse to decrypt them.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"concepts/architecture/#architecture","text":"Patents and patents-pending: WO2017060675A1, GB2543072A, US20180287803A1","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"concepts/architecture/#introduction","text":"The Enclave Network Fabric is client-side software, installed on operating systems running on bare metal, as virtual machines and hypervisors, on cloud compute resources or containers.

Note: The control channel relies on our Cloud services to help facilitate and introduce cooperating endpoints, but each data channel is negotiated and authenticated directly between cooperating endpoints with end-to-end encryption \u2014 without the involvement of the Enclave Cloud infrastructure.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"concepts/architecture/#part-1-udp-and-tcp-hole-punching","text":"UDP and TCP hole punching are commonly used techniques in peer-to-peer networking applications on the Internet involving hosts connecting to each other which reside in discreet and isolated private networks. Both hosts attempting to communicate (from behind NAT devices and closed firewalls) will start sending connection attempts or data to each other, using outbound traffic only and multiple attempts. The first packet received from the other host will be dropped, its firewall was closed and the network address translation table considered the traffic unsolicited. However, after that same firewall and NAT has a record of having sent a packet back to the other machine, it will allow any subsequent packets originating from the sender's address and port number as expected and solicited return traffic. Stated simply, both systems will attempt to communicate with one another simultaneously multiple times. The first a system receives will be dropped, but after that same system has sent data to the other host, any further data originating from that host will be allowed to traverse the firewall and NAT. The Enclave Discovery Service resides on the public Internet and is used to help connecting peers gain knowledge of, and then share with one another their respective public and private IP address information and source port numbers. This gives Enclave peers enough information to attempt UDP/TCP hole punching Direct Client-to-Client bi-directional connections using outbound-only traffic from their inside of their respective private networks, without infrastructure changes or opening the firewall. This technique is also widely used in many other types of peer-to-peer software including VoIP telephony and WebRTC. Security note: Local RFC 1918 IP address information is shared with the Discovery Service, which is in turn shared with cooperating parties with whom you are trying to establish direct, private network connectivity. In the context of WebRTC, sharing of private IP addresses via the client's browser is considered to be undesirable information disclosure as it allows websites to conduct covert reconnaissance and surveillance. Enclave is different. The principle of mutual intent requires cooperation and authentication before a connection is possible, so disclosure of private IP addresses is limited with Enclave to scenarios where Enclave is simply extending an existing real-world agreement to cooperate, as such disclosure of private IP addresses is not considered to be a security concern in this context.","title":"Part 1: UDP and TCP hole punching"},{"location":"concepts/architecture/#part-2-mutual-authentication","text":"After a bi-directional TCP/UDP connection has been established, it is important to remember that at this point that data channel is unauthenticated, and unencrypted. The connected parties transition the connection to a trusted state without outside assistance, support or communication from other parties. Prior to connection establishment, both systems had expressed intent to communicate with one another based on knowledge of the other system's certificate name. As each system holds its own certificate, and corresponding private key the pair have all the information they need to perform a standard authenticated key exchange. Both parties share their certificates with one another, and the recipient checks the name on the certificate matches an expected connection, and checks the validity of the received certificate. If the certificate is expected and valid, the sender is asked to sign a unique challenge to demonstrate knowledge of their private key to authenticate the connection. This is a mutual action, and both sides must attest knowledge of their private keys. Once the certificate are confirmed to be authentic, the party has gained knowledge of their peer's public key from the exchanged digital certificate. Authenticated knowledge of partner public key is used to compute the encryption keys for the connection.","title":"Part 2: Mutual Authentication"},{"location":"concepts/architecture/#part-3-end-to-end-encryption","text":"All cryptographic features and capabilities in Enclave are implemented with libsodium . Using shared knowledge of each other\u2019s public keys, the two parties can securely compute a set of shared keys using their peer's public key and their own private key. Enclave uses Ed25519 for digital signatures and Curve25519 for ephemeral key exchange and perfect forward secrecy. Algorithm details: rx || tx = BLAKE2B-512(p.n || client_pk || server_pk) One a set of share keys are computed, the rx and tx keys seed a symmetric cipher used to encrypt data before it is placed on the wire. If the processor supports hardware-accelerated AES using Intel SSSE3 extensions and aesni and pclmul instructions then Enclave will prefer the AES256-GCM cipher. Intel Westmere processors (introduced in 2010) and newer meet the requirements, and major cloud vendors (Azure, AWS, DigitalOcean) support these processor features sets across their entire fleet of instance types. For endpoints which are not capable of hardware-accelerated cryptography, Enclave will use ChaCha20-Poly1305 (ChaCha20 stream cipher and Poly1305 authentication MAC). Both ciphers are authenticated encryption schemes (AEAD ciphers) which can recognise improperly-constructed ciphertexts and refuse to decrypt them.","title":"Part 3: End-to-end Encryption"},{"location":"concepts/principles/","text":"","title":"Principles"},{"location":"concepts/connectivity/nat/","text":"","title":"Nat"},{"location":"concepts/connectivity/requirements/","text":"ports numbers outbound connectivity IP whitelisting our inf.","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"concepts/connectivity/telemetry/","text":"","title":"Telemetry"},{"location":"concepts/security/certificates/","text":"Key management","title":"Certificates"},{"location":"concepts/security/considerations/","text":"","title":"Considerations"},{"location":"concepts/security/encryption/","text":"","title":"Encryption"},{"location":"concepts/security/threat-model/","text":"","title":"Threat model"},{"location":"getting-started/attach-tags/","text":"Attach Tags Introduction Tags are free-form text labels attached to one or more systems in your account. Tags allow administrators to group systems together which share similar characteristics (i.e. business unit, security level or function). Tags can be manually added to an enrolled system, or an Enrolment Key can be configured to apply an initial set of Tags to enrolling systems. The following graphic illustrates how Tags could be applied to enrolled systems. Each enrolled system, the workstation desktop-d983gw and the server gitlab are members of Tags specific to their function; both systems are also members of the org.any Tag. When using tags in the portal, they have a particular style, so org.any is a tag, dev.internal is a tag, and so on. Where we reference tags in our docs we'll use the same format. Production use: This guide suggests example Tags. You can (and should) create Tags which reflect the structure of your organisation for use in production. Visit the Tags section of the handbook to learn more about creating, naming and managing Tags. Add Tags In the Portal, navigate to the Systems page and confirm at least two systems are enrolled and showing as connected. Tag your first system Select the first system you've enrolled to open its details pane. Use the pencil icon (top-right of the pane) to enter edit mode.

When a certificate is issued it contains NotBefore and a NotAfter fields expressed as a 64 bit integer offset from the Unix time epoch (seconds elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970). A value of -1 in the NotAfter field indicates the certificate has no effective expiry date, and has been issued in perpetuity. ... \"NotBefore\": 1549156210, \"NotAfter\": -1, ... Certificates should be issued with validity periods matching the expected lifetime of enrolling systems \u2014 hours, days, years, or in perpetuity. For systems which have no known future date of decommission, it is recommended to issue certificates that are valid in perpetuity. In the event of system, or private key compromise the certificate should be revoked using the portal. Perpetual Issue Certificates Traditional TLS certificate management best practices are evolving towards recommending against issuing certificates with extended lifetimes. The purpose of this section is to demonstrate that certificates don't need to expire to provide good security properties. Over the last decade, spurred mainly by the introduction of automation technologies wrapping the certificate renewal process and the advent of the wonderful LetsEncrypt project, conventional thinking has started to drift toward the use of short-lived certificates with TLS. There are several reasons for this, in short compromised certificates are hard to revoke, and the longer a certificate is valid, the more likely it can be used nefariously in the event of compromise precisely because revocation is tricky. Certificate revocation options are imperfect and represent a single point of failure (OCSP responders and CRL distribution points not recognised as reliable network parties, and soft-fails are common practice). Long-lived static keys have increased value to attackers and are exposed to the possibility of theft for longer. A shorter lifetime reduces exposure in the event of key compromise. Revocation infrastructure leads to huge certificate revocation lists and high traffic volume at OCSP servers. Automation is not encouraged by the use of long-lived certificates. In the event that a vulnerability is discovered in a cryptographic primitive (e.g. SHA1) shorter lived certificates force deprecated and vulnerable protocols out of the ecosystem far more quickly. The landscape of TLS is inherently fragmented, Browser vendors, Certificate Authorities, system administrators and software developers all exist in isolation of one another, operating independently and on different time scales. The fractured landscape of TLS means that short-lived certificates, which constantly refresh trust are a vital for the future development of the ecosystem. Enclave however, is not a fragmented landscape and does not suffer the same operational challenges which TLS must endure. Certificate revocation in the Enclave portal is instant and applied globally across your entire estate. Once a certificate is expired or revoked, all connections are instantly, immediately and irrevocably terminated. The most important thing to keep in mind is that the nature of key compromise is such that you almost never know it has happened until it is too late (consider Diginotar as an extreme example). When indicators of compromise suggest that a system may have been attacked, its certificate should be immediately revoked using the Portal (an operation which can be automated using the Portal API). In the event that a system compromise remains undetected, refreshing the private keys has little effect as the fresh keys would simply be extracted a second time from the same compromised system. Equally, Enclave benefits from automatic updates and (optional) forced shutdown of older versions where security vulnerabilities are uncovered, allowing organisations to centrally and effectively manage the risk vs. availability tradeoff. By nature of the fully managed platform, Enclave is able to overcome the drive towards short lived certificates mandated by the fragmented TLS ecosystem and offer the benefits of perpetual issue certificates with no adverse impact to your threat model. In short, for public infrastructure exposing TLS endpoints, short-lived certificates should be adopted wherever possible. Systems connected privately via Enclave can, and should confidently deploy perpetually issued certificates Enrolment key constraints In order to issue a certificate to an enrolling system, an Enrolment Key must first be created in the Portal. Enrolment Keys created without a configured Validity Period constraint will, by default, issue certificates that are valid in perpetuity. Enrolment Keys created with a Validity Period constraint will remain valid from the time when the Enrolment Key is used, for the expressed duration of the constraint. That is to say, if a Single Use Enrolment Key were created on the 1st of January, with a Validity Period constraint of 7 days, and remained unused until the 1st of February then - at the time of use - the resulting certificate would be valid for 7 days from the 1st of February. Short-lived, or fixed lifetime certificates are an ideal way to interact with the partners, the supply chain or contractors where an engagement or project has a fixed duration and the connection must not persist beyond a fixed point in time.

Enclave is designed to work in as many environments as possible. You normally don't need to open firewall ports for Enclave to work. Enclave uses NAT traversal techniques to automatically establish peer-to-peer connectivity between devices without administrators needing to manipulate the underlying network. However, when two devices are separated by certain kinds of network address translation (NAT) devices, it may not be possible for Enclave to build direct, peer-to-peer connections between those devices. Your devices will still be able to connect and communicate with one other thanks to traffic relays, but relayed traffic can be suboptimal compared to direct connectivity in terms of latency and throughput. If your network operates with an aggressive NAT configuration, you may consider opening firewall ports to help Enclave establish direct peer-to-peer connectivity. What ports does Enclave use? Enclave does not use a default port and instead randomises port selection each time it restarts.

Under Windows and macOS Enclave automatically manages the local name server search order. Enclave runs a local name server bound to the virtual network IP address of each profile. By default this service runs on port 53 and answers queries for names inside the .enclave. zone. By enabling DNS forwarding and including the local Enclave name server in the search order of your operating system's name server list, you can reference and connect to peers by name.

Last updated Aug 19, 2021","title":"100.64.0.0/10"},{"location":"kb/what-happens-if-enclave-is-down/","text":"Documentation / Knowledge Base What happens if Enclave is down? As described in our Architecture documentation, the Discovery Service is only centralised component of Enclave's architecture. It is responsible for enrolment of new systems along with computing and distributing policy to all Enclave devices on your network. However, if the discovery service goes down your Enclave network will mostly continue to function: What will work Enclave does not route any traffic through the Discovery Service. Most of the time, devices will talk directly to one another. In cases where a direct connection cannot be established, devices will fall back to using one or more traffic relays located in different regions all over the world. That means that in the event that the Discovery Service becomes unavailable, traffic in your Enclave networks will continue to move between your devices. Devices can continue to communicate with each other until either one of the devices experiences key material expiry, or until the network connection between those devices is lost or interrupted (Changing from a wired network to wireless network, for example). If the discovery service is unavailable for long enough, the key material held by each device may expire. In most cases the machine keys use to authenticate systems have a long lifetime, so it's more likely that if you're using an IdP integration to authenticate users as well as machine keys, then user identity key expiry may happen much more quickly. However, exactly when is device-dependent and based on the last time a user authentication took place, which is likely to be different between each device on the network. When Policy or configuration changes are made by platform administrators they are pushed your Enclave devices. Policy is both cached and enforced locally, meaning that your existing Policies, ACLs and connectivity arrangements will continue to function in the absence of the Discovery Service. What won't work On the other hand, without the Discovery Service available: Any devices which disconnect from one another will be unable to reconnect. Any devices which attempt to come online won't be able to connect. Any devices using user identity as part of the authentication requirements to construct tunnels will be unable to renew their keys, meaning that those devices will gradually lose access to each other. If the tunnel is only authenticated using machine keys however, it's unlikely that those machine keys will expire in a time-frame relevant to a service outage. Existing Policies and ACLs cannot be updated. Existing devices cannot be revoked and removed from your account. How we approach availability We engineer to achieve no less than 99.9% unplanned downtime for our Discovery Service and 99.999% availability for all other SaaS components. That may sound strange, to engineer for, and tolerate unplanned downtime of the Discovery Service at up to 99.9% per year for such a critical component, that's up to 8 hours, 45 minutes and 56 seconds of downtime every year. Let's unpick that. First of all, and let's be clear - Enclave is architected to be a highly available and highly resilient service, in fact we routinely far exceed 99.9% availability. However, the Discovery Service has a very unique architecture and special role in the availability of the overall platform. The Discovery Service is an extremely light-touch service and has relatively infrequent conversations with enrolled devices. Each device retains a full cache of the last conversation it has with the Discovery Service and operates with full autonomy in the event that it looses connection to the Discovery Service. In fact, if the connection is briefly lost it has no operational significance for the device, which just reconnects at the earliest opportunity. This architecture allows us to avoid investing diminishing returns to engineering for a higher-base level of availability and instead embrace the ephemeral role the Discovery Service plays in the Enclave platform. This in turn allows us to focus on engineering simplicity, which itself produces a stable, maintainable, predictable and easier to reason about platform. We do however invest heavily in achieving the lowest possible time-to-recovery in the event of failure. Like Chaos Monkey , we routinely simulate failure by taking the Discovery Service offline in micro-intervals as part of normal, daily routine operations. This keeps our platform not only resilient to failure, but expectant of it.

Most of the time, devices will talk directly to one another. In cases where a direct connection cannot be established, devices will fall back to using one or more traffic relays located in different regions all over the world. That means that in the event that the Discovery Service becomes unavailable, traffic in your Enclave networks will continue to move between your devices. Devices can continue to communicate with each other until either one of the devices experiences key material expiry, or until the network connection between those devices is lost or interrupted (Changing from a wired network to wireless network, for example). If the discovery service is unavailable for long enough, the key material held by each device may expire. In most cases the machine keys use to authenticate systems have a long lifetime, so it's more likely that if you're using an IdP integration to authenticate users as well as machine keys, then user identity key expiry may happen much more quickly. However, exactly when is device-dependent and based on the last time a user authentication took place, which is likely to be different between each device on the network. When Policy or configuration changes are made by platform administrators they are pushed your Enclave devices. Policy is both cached and enforced locally, meaning that your existing Policies, ACLs and connectivity arrangements will continue to function in the absence of the Discovery Service.","title":"What will work"},{"location":"kb/what-happens-if-enclave-is-down/#what-wont-work","text":"On the other hand, without the Discovery Service available: Any devices which disconnect from one another will be unable to reconnect.

That may sound strange, to engineer for, and tolerate unplanned downtime of the Discovery Service at up to 99.9% per year for such a critical component, that's up to 8 hours, 45 minutes and 56 seconds of downtime every year. Let's unpick that. First of all, and let's be clear - Enclave is architected to be a highly available and highly resilient service, in fact we routinely far exceed 99.9% availability. However, the Discovery Service has a very unique architecture and special role in the availability of the overall platform. The Discovery Service is an extremely light-touch service and has relatively infrequent conversations with enrolled devices. Each device retains a full cache of the last conversation it has with the Discovery Service and operates with full autonomy in the event that it looses connection to the Discovery Service. In fact, if the connection is briefly lost it has no operational significance for the device, which just reconnects at the earliest opportunity. This architecture allows us to avoid investing diminishing returns to engineering for a higher-base level of availability and instead embrace the ephemeral role the Discovery Service plays in the Enclave platform. This in turn allows us to focus on engineering simplicity, which itself produces a stable, maintainable, predictable and easier to reason about platform. We do however invest heavily in achieving the lowest possible time-to-recovery in the event of failure. Like Chaos Monkey , we routinely simulate failure by taking the Discovery Service offline in micro-intervals as part of normal, daily routine operations. This keeps our platform not only resilient to failure, but expectant of it. By designing to expect failure, when it happens it actually has almost no perceptible impact on on the overall operation of the platform, apart from to slightly increase latency on already eventually-consistent administrative transactions, like pushing updated policy out to enrolled systems.

Last updated May 5, 2022","title":"Notes"},{"location":"management/dns/","text":"DNS is the mechanism by which a name, e.g. myserver.enclave is resolved to an IP Address; in our case, an Enclave IP Address (e.g. 100.84.10.20 ). The Enclave DNS feature provides built-in DNS support for Enclave and allows you to define your own DNS names from a single central location in the portal or via our APIs. On each Enclave System, the installed agent runs a local authoritative DNS nameserver, bound to the local Enclave Virtual Adapter, that provides DNS services. On Windows and macOS, we automatically configure the operating system to use the Enclave nameserver. However on Linux you currently need to configure your DNS manually (because of the big variation in Linux DNS configurations). See our knowledge base article on how to configure DNS on Linux . Automatic ID Names When a System is enrolled, it is assigned a short, unique, System ID . This System ID is displayed in the System's detail view in the portal , in the Windows tray application, and when you run enclave status from the command line. All systems are automatically assigned a name based on their System ID, {systemId}.id.enclave . So, as an example, if a system has the id 488Q , it will always have the DNS name 488q.id.enclave . Adding a DNS Record To create a custom DNS record, go to your DNS settings in the portal . Organisations on our Business Plan can create additional custom DNS Zones in addition to the default enclave zone. See the section below on custom DNS zones for more info. To create a new DNS record, click \"Create New Record\"; then specify the hostname you want. You will get a preview of the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) as you type. Hostnames can only contain alphanumeric characters (A-Z,0-9), hyphens, and a period character to separate sections of the name. You can also enter the special '@' character on its own to create an apex record , which creates a record with the name of the zone. Adding Targets There are two ways to specify which systems should be resolved for a given DNS name. The first is using Tags . You can specify a list of tags for the hostname. Any system with one of the specified tags will be resolvable from the name you defined. The second is by specifying exactly the systems you wish to resolve with that name. In general, we suggest attaching DNS names by tag if you can, because it is less brittle, and easy to replace the System that provides a given application or service without updating the DNS record. You can combine tag and system targeting on a single DNS record. Viewing Names applied to a System In the Detail pane of each System in your Organisation, there is the full list of all names currently applied to the system, as well as an indication as to how that system got the name (via a system or tags assignment). DNS Load Balancing If more than one system has a given name assigned to it, either directly, or because of a tag, then implicit DNS load balancing kicks in. If a System resolves a name with multiple systems assigned to it, it will randomly resolve to one of the systems it is connected to with that name. That last point about being connected to the system is important, because it means you can also set up geographically segmented networks that resolve a different System IP Address based on the policies in place for the System, all from the same DNS name. Why no TTL? DNS changes you make in the portal are propagated immediately to every impacted system, without any need to specify a Time-To- Live for the record. You don't need to worry about systems getting out of sync with regards to what names they understand. Custom Zones (Business Plan) Every organisation has a default enclave zone pre-defined, to which you can add as many DNS records as you wish, but they will all have the .enclave suffix on your names. Organisations on our Business Plan (see pricing ) can also create any number of custom zones, with any TLD they wish. You can use this feature to help organise your DNS names, or create names that match certificates issued for existing publicly-managed names. Renaming Zones You can rename a custom zone after creating it. This will update the FQDN (fully-qualified domain name) of all records inside the zone to respect the new FQDN. Changing a zone's name will immediately change all of the DNS names on that zone from the perspective of client systems, so make sure you understand what systems might need to be reconfigured after the change. Note, you will not be able to rename a zone if the new name results in record FQDN clashes with names in an existing zone.","title":"DNS"},{"location":"management/dns/#automatic-id-names","text":"When a System is enrolled, it is assigned a short, unique, System ID .

Any enrolled system can be easily switched between locally, or centrally managed modes at any time simply by adding, or removing tags in the Portal.

If a Portal Administrator removes all of the tags from a particular system, Enclave will allow the end-user(s) to manage connectivity.

If you have feedback on this feature, please let us know in one of our community support channels. Introduction Enclave is designed to be installed directly on every client, server, cloud instance, virtual machine and container in your organisation. That way, Enclave can apply Zero Trust Network Access controls between systems, fully enforce policy and provide end-to-end encryption. However, in some situations, you can\u2019t or might not want to install Enclave on all systems: On domain controllers where two or more network interfaces can be problematic On networks where the physical infrastructure is not allowed to be changed On embedded systems, like firewalls, webcams or printers which prohibit external software When accessing legacy systems which are too old to run, or are incompatible, with the agent When accessing cloud native services like AWS RDS, which don't run third party software With large numbers of devices in a single subnet, like a single AWS VPC Here, you can set up an \u201cexit node\u201d to access systems not running Enclave from another system in the same subnet which is. An exit node acts like a gateway, moving traffic from your Enclave peers into your physical subnet and back. Prerequisites Before you begin this guide, you\u2019ll need an Enclave account set up with at least two devices enrolled. Read our getting started guide if you need help with this. Your Exit Node system must be running Linux. Currently, we only support Linux systems as exit nodes, but we plan to support this feature on Windows and macOS in the future. Limitations A system functioning as an exit node can route data to a subnet of any size. You can provide routes to subnets as large as a /0 or as small as a single IP address ( /32 ) as you find necessary for appropriate segmentation. The same exit node system can provide routes to multiple subnets if that system has a network interface and routes to the relevant subnet(s). The present design of exit node behaviour allows one or more Enclave peers (connected to an exit node) to route traffic into the exit nodes's local subnet(s) and for any devices inside that local subnet to reply. However, Enclave will not allow unsolicited traffic from a device inside the local subnet to send unsolicited traffic into the Enclave overlay network. As an example, a home worker's laptop could exchange packets with a printer and domain controller in an office network via an exit node, but the printer and domain controller would be unable to initiate unsolicited connectivity to that home worker's laptop. This is because the overlay network between Enclave peers provides a level of trust that cannot be replicated on the unencrypted and unauthenticated physical network. To configure an exit node on a Linux system installation, follow these steps: Step 1: Install your exit node Download and install Enclave onto the system which will be your exit node and provide an enrolment key to join it to your account. We support a variety of Linux distros. Step 2: Set up your exit node You will need to edit an Enclave configuration file, so stop the Enclave process, you can use sudo enclave stop or sudo systemctl stop enclave . Now that Enclave is stopped, use the editor of your choice to open the default configuration file Universe.profile . $ sudo nano /etc/enclave/profiles/Universe.profile At the bottom of the JSON file you'll see an empty property called \"ExitNode\": {} . As shown below, add a ProvidesRoutes array. Replace the subnets in the example below with the right ones for your network. You can add one, or more IPv4 subnets in CIDR notation. In this example we've added two subnets. \"ExitNode\" : { \"ProvidesRoutes\" : [ \"172.26.0.0/20\" , \"172.84.0.0/20\" ] } Save this file and exit your text editor. The exit node feature also requires IP forwarding to be enabled in the Linux kernel. Enable it as follows: $ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 $ sudo sysctl -p Next, you'll need to configure iptables to forward traffic originating from the overlay network (100.64.0.0/10 by default) out to your local subnet(s). You'll need to replace the -d argument below with your own subnet (i.e. change 172.26.0.0/20 in this example) and change the --to address to be the IPv4 address of your exit node in its local subnet, so also change 172.26.0.3 to match your network. $ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 100.64.0.0/10 -d 172.26.0.0/20 -j SNAT --to 172.26.0.3 Add one source NAT postrouting rule as shown above for each subnet you're planning to advertise via this exit node. Now you've configured the exit node, you can restart Enclave. You can use sudo enclave start or sudo systemctl start enclave . Lastly, run enclave status and make a note of your exit node's Local identity as you will need this in the next step. Each identity is unique to each system. In our example, our exit node's identity was G982V but yours will be different. Step 3: Set up any other systems We'll assume you already have Enclave installed and enrolled on other systems in your account, if not you'll need to. Login to one of your other systems which will act as a client to the exit node and route traffic to one of the advertised subnets. Any supported operating system (currently Windows, macOS and Linux) can be set up to route traffic via your new exit node. During the beta, without centralised management available, you'll need to manually configure each system that needs to access the subnet(s) provided by the exit node. You'll need to tell each system which of its peers is providing the access to those subnets, and what those subnets are too. Let's get started. You'll need to edit the Universe.profile configuration file on each system, so make sure you stop Enclave using either sudo enclave stop or sudo systemctl stop enclave . Now Enclave is stopped, use the editor of your choice to open the default Enclave configuration file. Linux Windows MacOS On Linux this file is located at: /etc/enclave/profiles/Universe.profile On Windows this file is located at: C:\\Program Files\\Enclave Networks\\Enclave\\Agent\\profiles\\Universe.profile On macOS this file is located in: /etc/enclave/profiles/Universe.profile Just like in step 2, you'll notice an empty \"ExitNode\": {} property at the bottom of the JSON file. This time we'll be adding AvailableRoutes . \"ExitNode\" : { \"AvailableRoutes\" : { \"G982V\" : [ \"172.26.0.0/20\" ] } } You'll need to replace the identity we've used ( G982V ) with your own exit node's identity that you made a note of at the end of step 2. You'll also need to replace the subnet we've used here with your own (i.e. 172.16.0.0/24 in this example). Now this system knows which peer it should route 172.16.0.0/24 traffic towards, you could also configure it to use multiple exit nodes for different subnets, as shown below. \"ExitNode\" : { \"AvailableRoutes\" : { \"G982V\" : [ \"172.26.0.0/20\" , \"172.84.0.0/20\" ] , \"Q8QW8\" : [ \"192.168.0.0/24\" ] } } Now you've configured this system to use your exit node, you can restart Enclave using sudo enclave start or sudo systemctl start enclave . Now that you've configured the AvailableRoutes property, Enclave will automatically adjust the local routing table for you. Step 4: Connect it all together Make sure your client systems can talk to the exit node using Enclave. We suggest tagging your exit node as exit-node (or similar) and creating a policy which allows your clients to access your exit-node system. Step 5: Verify the connection Check that you can ping your new exit node from your client machine, use the exit node's Enclave Virtual address (i.e. 100.64.69.156 in the example below). You can find the Enclave Virtual address of your exit node by running enclave status on either system once they are connected. You should also notice in the output of the enclave status command on the client system(s) that any route(s) you've advertised via your exit node are listed under the appropriate peer, as shown below. If you can ping the exit node (i.e. ping 100.64.0.70 in this example) via Enclave and your local system is showing 172.26.0.0/20 (or your equivalent subnet) as the Exit node for value against the correct peer, you should now be able to start sending traffic directly into that subnet via your new exit node. Step 6: Use your exit node Now we know the exit node itself is reachable, try sending some traffic past the exit node to the subnet behind it. If the any of the host-based firewalls on systems not running Enclave in your subnet(s) adjacent to the exit node allow it, you may be able to send pings as test of end-to-end connectivity. In the example below I've been able to send a ping from a Windows laptop in a coffee shop, via the Enclave exit node at 172.26.0.3 in the office out to a printer with an IP address of 172.26.0.250 in the local subnet.

Check that the client(s) can ping the exit node using the exit node's Enclave address. Check the output of enclave status on all systems has the correct Exit node for values. Check that the exit node itself can reach (i.e. ping) other servers on its local subnet. Check the routing table has been correctly configured by Enclave on the client(s). The routing table is configured automatically by Enclave so unlikely to be the source of a problem unless there are other conflicting routes already in place. The Interface address is the client's local Enclave IP address.

If they're not then the iptables configuration may be incorrect or the routing table on the client may not be correct. Try running Enclave as a foreground process with high log verbosity.

The same exit node system can provide routes to multiple subnets if that system has a network interface and routes to the relevant subnet(s). The present design of exit node behaviour allows one or more Enclave peers (connected to an exit node) to route traffic into the exit nodes's local subnet(s) and for any devices inside that local subnet to reply. However, Enclave will not allow unsolicited traffic from a device inside the local subnet to send unsolicited traffic into the Enclave overlay network. As an example, a home worker's laptop could exchange packets with a printer and domain controller in an office network via an exit node, but the printer and domain controller would be unable to initiate unsolicited connectivity to that home worker's laptop.

You'll need to replace the -d argument below with your own subnet (i.e. change 172.26.0.0/20 in this example) and change the --to address to be the IPv4 address of your exit node in its local subnet, so also change 172.26.0.3 to match your network. $ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 100.64.0.0/10 -d 172.26.0.0/20 -j SNAT --to 172.26.0.3 Add one source NAT postrouting rule as shown above for each subnet you're planning to advertise via this exit node.

While in beta, this feature doesn't include API endpoints or Portal control and must be manually configured on each system. This page will be updated as the feature enters general availability. If you have feedback on this feature, please let us know at support@enclave.io . Introduction Having deeper visibility and insights into your network usage and performance can greatly improve your ability to assess your network security state, troubleshoot and diagnose issues more efficiently, and help you answer questions about your network in real-time. Understanding user access behaviour and knowing what traffic is flowing through your network enables you to discover threats quickly and assist in validating that your intended network security policies are in place. To facilitate this level of network visibility and monitoring your network requires tools that can efficiently generate valuable metadata from your network traffic in real-time. This metadata can then be analysed to provide the visibility and insights described above. Network metadata-based tools such as NetFlow and IPFIX are well known in the network industry. These tools and protocols all share a common architecture: Flow Exporter \u2013 Generates network flow metadata and exports the metadata towards one or more flow collectors. Flow Collector - responsible for reception, storage and pre-processing of flow metadata received from a flow exporter. Flow Analysis Application - analyses flow metadata in the context of reporting, intrusion detection, traffic profiling, network performance, user access behaviour, etc. Traditionally flow exporters are implemented on network devices such as routers, switches and firewalls. End-to-end encrypted overlay networks such as Enclave make it impossible for these network devices to extract metadata from the actual underlying application traffic as they can only \u201csee\u201d the already encrypted overlay packets. This is where the Enclave Network Flow Metadata feature comes into play. Enclave Network Flow Metadata The Enclave Network Flow Metadata feature provides the functionality to generate network flow metadata on traffic going over the encrypted Enclave overlay. Enclave Network Flow Metadata implements an IPFIX exporter. IPFIX is an IETF protocol that provides a universal standard for the export and collection of IP flow metadata. The Enclave IPFIX exporter conforms to RFC 7011 and RFC 7012 . IPFIX Collectors The Enclave IPFIX exporter generates network flow metadata and sends it to one or more collectors using the IPFIX protocol. The collectors are responsible for storage and processing of the flow metadata received from the Enclave IPFIX exporter, and they typically also provide the flow analysis and insights applications. Since the Enclave Network Flow Metadata feature implements a standards-based IPFIX exporter, it should be compatible with any collector that supports the IPFIX standard. We have tested integration with the following 3rd party collectors: ElastiFlow , Plixer Scrutinizer , Noction , Paessler PRTG IPFIX Analyzer IPFIX Templates Enclave implements IPFIX templates for exporting IPv4/IPv6 TCP, IPv4/IPv6 UDP, raw IPv4/IPv6, and ICMPv4 flow information. Limitation The IPFIX specification defines three transport protocols that can be used to transport flow information from the exporter to the collector: SCTP, TCP and UDP. Our research found that all IPFIX collectors support UDP almost exclusively as their transport protocol. As such, we have focused our efforts on implementing UDP as the transport protocol for the Enclave exporter. Configuration To enable and configure the Enclave Network Flow Metadata feature on your system, you will need to edit your Enclave configuration file. Follow these steps: Step 1: Stop the Enclave process On Windows, right click on the Enclave tray icon, click on Universe and then click on Stop . You can also stop Enclave in a Windows command prompt using enclave stop C:\\> enclave stop On Linux you can use sudo enclave stop or sudo systemctl stop enclave Step 2: Edit your Enclave configuration file On Windows the Enclave configuration file is located at C:\\Program Files\\Enclave Networks\\Enclave\\Agent\\profiles\\Universe.profile . We recommend you edit the configuration file through the Enclave tray application by clicking on the settings icon in the top left corner of the Enclave application and selecting Edit profile configuration file... , or you can manually edit the file. When manually editing the configuration file you will need to run your editor, e.g. Notepad, as Administrator. On Linux the Enclave configuration file is located at /etc/enclave/profiles/Universe.profile and can be edited using your preferred editor, e.g. $ sudo nano /etc/enclave/profiles/Universe.profile Step 3: Configure Enclave Network Flow Metadata Enclave Network Flow Metadata is configured using the JSON property FlowMetadata . Under FlowMetadata we provide the following configuration properties and options: IpFixCollectors - A list of zero of more IPFIX collector endpoints in the string format \" Udp/Collector IP Address:Port \" e.g. Udp/172.16.1.100:4739 . The example specifies that UDP is the transport protocol to use, 172.16.1.100 is the IP address of the IPFIX collector and the collector is listening on UDP port 4739 . You can specify multiple IPFIX collectors and Enclave will forward IPFIX flow information to all configured collectors. By default no exporters are configured. Direction - Valid string values are Both , SendingToPeer and ReceivedFromPeer . The default value if not specified is Both . IPFIX supports single direction flow information per data record. This means a normal bidirectional flow e.g. a TCP session, will generate two IPFIX data records, one for ingress information and a second for egress information. This is the default behaviour and what will be expected when you configure Both as the direction. In certain circumstances this might not be ideal; imagine you are running Enclave on System A and System B, both have IPFIX enabled and is monitoring a TCP session between them. With the default Both direction, System A will export both ingress and egress data, while System B will also export both ingress and egress data. This means you end up with 4 flow records for a single TCP session. With the SendingToPeer and ReceivedFromPeer direction options you can limit flow information export to either egress information or ingress information respectively. There is one exception to the direction setting. Frames dropped due to violation of Trust Requirements or Access Control Rules will always generate an IPFIX record and be exported, irrespective of the direction setting. For example, even if you have configure ReceivedFromPeer , if an outgoing frame to a remote Enclave peer is dropped due to either a Trust Requirements or an Access Control Rules violation, Enclave will still report on this egress record. Interval - The interval in milliseconds at which Enclave will generate and export interim IPFIX flow records. If Interval is set to 0, then Enclave will not generate interim flow records, but will only generate and export flow records at the end of each flow. Interval should be either 0, or a multiple of 60000 (1 minute) as Enclave only processes interim records on a 1-minute frequency. The default value is 0. Enabled - Valid values are true or false . Used to enable or disable the Enclave IPFIX exporter feature. The default value is true . Note that if you have enabled IPFIX through this setting but have not configured a collector in IpFixCollectors , then the Enclave IPFIX exporter will effectively be disabled. You need to both set enabled to true and have a collector configured for the Enclave collector to function. To add the IPFIX configuration options, add the JSON settings at the bottom of the Enclave configuration file you opened in Step 2. The following example enables IPFIX and adds a single IPFIX collector with IP address 172.16.1.100 that is listing on UDP port 4739. Enclave will be configured to export both ingress and egress flow information, and interim IPFIX flow records will be generated every 60 seconds (60000 milliseconds). \"FlowMetadata\" :{ \"IpFixCollectors\" : [ \"Udp/172.16.1.100:4739\" ], \"Direction\" : \"Both\" \"Interval\" : 60000 , \"Enabled\" : true } Save the configuration file. Step 4: Start the Enclave process Once you have saved the IPFIX configuration you can start the Enclave process again. On Windows, right click on the Enclave tray icon, click on Universe and then click on Start . You can also start Enclave in a Windows command prompt using enclave start C:\\> enclave start On Linux you can use sudo enclave start or sudo systemctl start enclave Enclave should now be running with the IPFIX exporter feature enabled and you should start receiving flow records in your IPFIX collector.

In much the same way, Enclave will allow systems in the Sender role to originate traffic to systems in the Receiver role but not the reverse. Systems are grouped together under common Tags and Tags are attached to Policies. As an example, consider the following policy: Policy Name Sender Tags Receiver Tags Kubernetes access developers contractors kubernetes-pods Any system which is a member of either the developers or contractors Tags will be connected to any system in the kubernetes-pods Tag, but systems in the developers Tag will not be connected to other developers or contractors by this Policy. Systems in the kubernetes-pods Tag will be unable to initiate outbound connections to developers or contractors systems, as the Receiver role prohibits unsolicited traffic and only allows responses to traffic which originated from a system with the Sender role. Unlike the public Internet, without an Enclave connection in place between two peers, no traffic can be send across an Enclave link; this means access controls can be exclusively Receiver defined. There is no way to apply sender-side restrictions to an Enclave peer to prohibit what can or can't be sent to other peers, all access controls are applied by the Receiver and govern what each system is willing to accept. Depending on how Administrators arrange Tags in each a Policy they may create either partially connected or fully connected mesh topologies. Access Control Rules Once you have indicated which systems should be communicating, using tags, you then want to define what traffic is allowed to move between Sender and Receiver. You can control this per-policy with Access Control Rules . Access Control Rules allow you to define which protocol and port(s) you want to allow into systems on the Receiver side of the Policy. Applying Access Controls at the Receiver side of a policy makes the entire system much easier to reason about. You can set up traffic rules in a similar way to setting up firewall rules to allow access to a service. The way rules are applied should feel pretty intuitive, but fundamentally: If you don't specify any rules on your policy, no traffic will flow (default deny) Each ACL rule only applies to connections between the senders and receivers of the policy where it was defined. Different rules on different policies affecting the same systems are combined, but still respecting rule #2. When you create a new policy, by default we add a rule that allows All Traffic to flow between Sender and Receiver. Remove this rule to restrict the set of traffic you want to allow. Sender Trust Requirements You can apply trust requirements directly to policies, which indicate requirements for all systems on the sender side of the policy. Systems must meet all the specified requirements before their connectivity granted by this policy can establish. If a sender originally meets all the requirements, but subsequently stops meeting one or more requirements (e.g. by logging out on the device), the policy stops taking effect (including any existing connections). Naming The Enclave access control model is defined by the Receiver role of each Policy, so Policy names should normally reflect the resource accessed and consumer(s) in an X for Y pattern. For example if a Policy defines access to a GitLab server for Developers, naming the policy GitLab for Developers provides a clear and concise description. Separate policies may grant access to the same resource or set of resources. For example, one Policy may grant Developers to access Database Servers during working hours and a separate policy may grant the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team 24/7 access to the same Database Servers. Database Servers for Developers Database Servers for SRE Topology Connectivity is established between the systems with membership in Tags attached on the Sender and Receiver side, but never between systems on the same side. Partially connected mesh In a partially connected mesh, only specific systems connect to one another across the policy. This assumes that no systems belong to Tags on multiple sides of the Policy. Policy Name Sender Tags Receiver Tags Server access for Workstations workstations servers Fully connected mesh Full mesh connectivity arises when multiple systems are members of Tags on both sides of a Policy, all affected systems are connected to one another. In the following example a Policy defines connectivity between systems tagged as servers . Policy Name Sender Tags Receiver Tags Servers full mesh servers servers Fully connected mesh networks may create large numbers of connections between participating systems. The number of connections in a fully connected mesh is equal to N\u2217(N\u22121)/2 (i.e. number of systems times the number of systems minus 1, divided by 2). A fully connected mesh of 16 systems will create 120 connections, where as a mesh twice the size with 32 participants will create 496 connections. You should consider the capabilities of your underlying network infrastructure when deploying a fully connected mesh as some stateful network appliances impose limits on the maximum number of connections they can track or support.","title":"Policy"},{"location":"management/policy/#access-control","text":"Each Policy is composed of Tags which are assigned to one of two roles: a Sender role and a Receiver role.

Tags can be manually added to enrolled systems, or an Enrolment Key can be configured to apply an initial set of Tags to new systems as they enrol to your account. Usage Tags form the building blocks of policies and policies define connectivity between enrolled systems. Instead of directly attaching systems to a Policy, Administrators use Tags to freely group enrolled systems together which can be referenced once across many policies. The decoupling which Tags provide allows policies to be defined once and remain static, while the business shifts and evolves underneath. For example, if an Administrator creates a developers Tag and a kubernetes-pods Tag, and then defines a Kubernetes access Policy which allows developers direct access to kubernetes-pods ; then systems in the developers Tag can change over time, so can members of the kubernetes-pods Tag as new instances are spun up and old instances are shutdown. The policy however (the business intent underpinning connectivity between those groups) remains in-place, constant and unchanged. Managed vs. unmanaged systems: When one or more Tags are attached to a system, that system automatically switches into Managed mode. This means all connectivity for that system must be defined by Policy and that the Enclave software on that system will no longer accept commands from the local user(s). Conversely, if no Tags are attached to a system then the opposite is true; the system enters Unmanaged mode and users are able to configure and control the Enclave software locally. Naming conventions It is considered best practice to define a naming pattern which reflects the structure and security model of your organisation, and group systems along those lines when defining Tags. A valid Tag name is composed of lower-case characters ( a-z and 0-9 without spaces) and may be up to 64 characters long. Valid separator characters include - and .

If your installation fails and you are unable to resolve the problem, please contact support@enclave.io . Unattended installation To support unattended installation, suitable for deployment through Group Policy, Configuration Manager, or some other automated deployment system, we recommend the use of our separate \"unattended\" installers, optimised for bulk distribution and silent running. For most use-cases, you should use the 'exe' form of the unattended installer. To deploy, follow these steps. Retrieve the latest version of the unattended installer: Download Unattended EXE Installer Package checksum ( loading ... ) ---------------------------------------------------------------- Distribute as needed via Group Policy, Configuration Manager, or any other deployment method that allows installers to run with elevated permissions on the machine. To run the installer in silent mode (with no UI), you pass the -q command line argument, like so: ./enclave-setup-unattended-<version>.exe -q You can also provide the Enclave enrolment key to the unattended installer to automatically enrol Enclave during installation, so no end-user interaction is required to get set up: ./enclave-setup-unattended-<version>.exe -q ENROLMENT_KEY=XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX Providing an invalid enrolment key will cause the installation to fail (and roll back). Note: If providing an enrolment key to the installer, at the time of install the system will require an internet connection to perform the enrolment. If you need to deploy on a machine with no current internet connection, deploy the installer without the ENROLMENT_KEY property, then use the CLI enclave enrol command later to enrol the system. Updating Enclave To update an unattended installation, distribute the new version of the unattended installer via the same method as you used when deploying originally; existing enrolled systems will have their configuration and identity preserved during the upgrade. The running instance of Enclave will stop and then restart with the new version automatically. Uninstalling Enclave Removing Enclave from a system (when Enclave was installed via unattended mode) can either be done by normal Windows uninstall mechanisms (i.e. via Apps and Features), or by running the unattended installer with the -uninstall argument. For example, to perform a silent uninstall: Distributing Enclave as an MSI file Enclave's unattended installer is also available as an MSI file. This can be useful if your tooling requires .msi files, or if you want to embed the Enclave installer into an existing package. The downside of the MSI file is that it does not bundle the Visual C++ Redistributable with it, so you will need to ensure that your packaging process includes the VC++ redistributable as well; see this Microsoft document for details, and where to download the redistributable. You can download the last MSI installer here: Download Unattended MSI Installer Package checksum ( loading ... ) ---------------------------------------------------------------- Then run it using msiexec : msiexec /i enclave-setup-unattended-<version>.exe /quiet ENROLMENT_KEY=XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX function populateDownload(manifest, releaseType, containerId) { fetch(manifest, { method: 'get' }) .then(response => response.json()) .then(jsonResult => { var latest = jsonResult.ReleaseVersions.reverse().find(releaseVersion => { return releaseVersion.ReleaseType === releaseType }); var url = latest?.Packages[0].Url; var hash = latest?.Packages[0].Hash; var hashAlg = latest?.Packages[0].HashAlg; var container = document.getElementById(containerId); container.querySelector('.download-button').href = url; container.querySelector('.download-url').innerHTML = url; container.querySelector('.hash-alg').innerHTML = hashAlg.toLowerCase(); container.querySelector('.checksum').innerHTML = base64ToHex(hash); }) .catch(err => { console.log(err); var container = document.getElementById(containerId); container.querySelector('.download-button').href = \"https://portal.enclave.io/my/new-system\"; }); } populateDownload(\"https://install.enclave.io/manifest/windows/setup.json\", 'GA', 'download-primary'); populateDownload(\"https://install.enclave.io/manifest/windows/setup-unattended-exe.json\", 'GA', 'download-unattended-exe'); populateDownload(\"https://install.enclave.io/manifest/windows/setup-unattended-msi.json\", 'GA', 'download-unattended-msi'); function base64ToHex(str) { const raw = atob(str); let result = ''; for (let i = 0; i < raw.length; i++) { const hex = raw.charCodeAt(i).toString(16); result += (hex.length === 2 ? hex : '0' + hex); } return result; }","title":"Windows"},{"location":"setup/windows/#windows","text":"This guide applies to Windows 7, 8, 10, 11 and Windows Server 2012, 2016, 2019 and 2022 (all editions).

Platform connectivity problems If you think Enclave is having trouble reaching our SaaS services, please work through the following checklist to identify the problem. Check https://status.enclave-networks.com/ for any disruptions or service outages Check your systems are enrolled and showing as both connected and approved in the portal Check you're running on the latest version of Enclave with enclave version Check the output of enclave status doesn't contain any warnings or errors Check the output of enclave status lists at least one Peer and the state shows as Up Check network traffic is allowed out to tcp/*:443 Check network traffic is allowed out to udp/*:1024-65355 Check network traffic isn't forced through a SOCKS proxy, which is currently unsupported Check local anti-virus software is not interfering with Enclave by temporarily disabling it Problems enrolling new peers Check https://status.enclave-networks.com/ for disruptions or service outages If you're running on Linux check that the ca-certificates package is up to date Check that the date and time on the enrolling system is accurate Traffic not flowing between peers If Enclave appears to be connected to our SaaS services and other peers, but you can't get network traffic to cross the tunnel, please work through the following checklist to identify the problem. Check the Enclave network interface is online using ipconfig /all . Look for Ethernet adapter Universe in the list and check that Media State is not shown as Media disconnected . If it is, try running enclave restart and consider sharing local Enclave logs with support@enclave.io to help us investigate the problem.

Check that the Peer state of the peer you're trying to reach is showing as Up in the enclave status output. When trying to ping another peer connected via Enclave, check that your ping requests are targeting the Virtual address of the destination peer and not the Local address . Check the routing table on each peer is configured correctly. The routing table is configured automatically by Enclave so unlikely to be the source of a problem unless there are other conflicting routes already in place. Check for duplicate entries or conflicting routes in your routing table, or other network interfaces also using the 100.64.0.0/64 subnet. C:\\> route print | findstr 100.64.0.0 IPv4 Route Table =========================================================================== Active Routes: Network Destination Netmask Gateway Interface Metric 100.64.0.0 255.192.0.0 On-link 100.117.177.98 281 Check the MTU configured in the .profile files matches on both sides of the tunnel Using Ping to verify connectivity If you're using ping tests to verify connectivity, it's important to check that the host-local firewall is not dropping traffic arriving on the Enclave network interface. Check that the host-local firewall on both peers is not obstructing traffic flows either to, or from the Enclave network interfaces. On Linux the Enclave network interface is likely to be named tap0 (or similar) and on Windows the Enclave network interface is usually called Universe or Enclave Virtual Network Port . The easiest way to verify that the host-local firewall is not interfering with Enclave traffic is to temporarily disable it, but if that's not possible for in environment, you should ensure ping traffic (icmp type 8, code 0) is permitted by the host-local firewall. On Windows, you should check that the Enclave network interface is correctly classified by the Windows Firewall as Private and if required, create an ACL permitting inbound ICMP traffic using PowerShell: New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"ICMPv4 (In)\" -Profile Private -Direction Inbound -Protocol ICMPv4 -Program Any -Action Allow` Check that the ACLs defined by your Policies are allowing ICMP traffic to flow on both systems by examining the ACLs reported by enclave status on each peer. For example, if your attempts to ping a target system are timing out, check that the system you're sending the pings from has an allow ACL like allow [X] from local -> peer where X is either [any] or includes the word icmp . Critically you're checking that the Enclave local -> peer ACL on the sender-side of the tunnel permits icmp (or any ) to be sent. If it does, that means the peer -> local ACL on the receiver side of the tunnel also permits that traffic to be received too. ACLs in Enclave are symmetric, so if the sender-side is allowed to send ICMP traffic, the receiver-side will implicitly be allowed to receive it. DNS resolution not working Obtain your Enclave local IP address using the enclave get-ip command. That's the IP address which the local DNS stub resolver will bind to ( udp\\53 ). C:\\> enclave get-ip 100.117.177.98 Use nslookup to send a test query to the Enclave nameserver identified in step 1 by attempting to resolve the special DNS name _my.id.enclave . It should resolve to your own local Enclave IP address, the same IP as the nameserver you're querying. C:\\> nslookup _my.id.enclave 100.117.177.98 Server: UnKnown Address: 100.117.177.98 Name: _my.id.enclave Address: 100.117.177.98 If the DNS query fails, check there isn't other software bound to your Enclave Local address on port udp/53 If you're running Enclave on a Linux operating system or inside a container, check that you've correctly configured DNS forwarding to ensure DNS queries from the operating system are reaching the local Enclave DNS stub resolver. Some ISPs hijack DNS queries to serve ads. Check that your primary recursive nameserver correctly returns a SRVFAIL response when queried with a hostname it should be unable to resolve. Some ISPs run nameservers which return IP addresses for ad servers instead of a SRVFAIL for non-existent domains. The ping request shown below to the non-existing hostname null.enclave.io should fail. If it does not, your ISPs nameservers may be hijacking your DNS requests to serve ads, in which case we recommend contacting your ISP to disable this function or switching to another primary resolver. C:\\> ping null.enclave.io Ping request could not find host null.enclave.io. Please check the name and try again. DNS queries slow to complete On Windows, check that the Enclave network interface doesn't list more than one DNS nameserver. If it does, please remove the DNS server that does not match the Enclave Local address shown by the enclave get-ip command. Exit nodes not working See our Exit Node troubleshooting guide . Advanced troubleshooting Try running Enclave as a foreground process with high log verbosity enabled sudo enclave run -v 5 to inspect traffic flows. Try running tcpdump or WireShark to capture from the tap0 interface (or Enclave Virtual Network Port on Windows, usually also called Universe ) and inspect the traffic flows.

Synology are market leaders in network attached storage devices, perfect for home or small business use. Enclave helps you easily build safe, secure and private network connectivity without the hassle of configuring firewalls and VPNs, or needing to manage IP addresses, subnets, ACLs, NAT, routing tables, certificates and secret keys. In this article we will show you how to easily provide private remote access to your Synology NAS drive without needing to open ports or setup a VPN server, darkening your network to third parties by installing Enclave. Before you begin, you will need: An Enclave account (Register here , for free) A Synology NAS drive running at least DSM 7.0 (currently in Beta) Administrative access to your Synology NAS drive When setup, Enclave will be running inside a Docker container on your Synology NAS drive. At the time of writing, Docker can only be installed on devices from the Synology Plus Series product line (not the Value Series) so please check to see if your system is a supported model . The Synology NAS allows administrators to fully own their devices, enabling SSH and dropping into a root bash prompt on the DSM software, Synology's Linux-based operating system. Okay, lets get started. If you have opened administrative access ports on your Synology NAS drive to the public Internet (default ports are 5000, 5001 and 22 for SSH) you should re-consider if they really need to be open and close those ports if not. They are the default HTTP and HTTPS web server ports for Synology DSM and allow access to the administration console. 1. Enable SSH access First, you'll need to enable SSH access to your Synology NAS drive. For Enclave to create a virtual network interface, we'll need to ensure that the tun kernel module is installed and enabled on the device. We do this by enabling and connecting into the device via SSH. Open the Control Panel , navigate to Terminal & SNMP and enable the SSH service. 2. Install the TUN kernel module With SSH enabled, log into your NAS using the admin account and check to see if the tun kernel module is installed and enabled. $ lsmod | grep -w tun If lsmod returns no results, you'll need to use insmod to install it. $ sudo insmod /lib/modules/tun.ko Now check lsmod again, you should see tun module is now loaded: tun 19133 0 We don't need SSH access any more, if you're not going to use it again please go back and disable the SSH service in the DSM Control Panel. This was not a permanent change, the module will be unloaded the next time the system reboots, so lets create a script which can be scheduled to run on start-up which will re-install tun.ko at boot. Switch to root $ sudo su - Create the following script on your Synology file system by typing vim /volume1/enable-tun.sh #!/bin/sh if ( [ ! -c /dev/net/tun ] ); then if ( [ ! -d /dev/net ] ); then mkdir -m 755 /dev/net fi mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200 fi if ( !(lsmod | grep -q \"^tun\\s\") ); then insmod /lib/modules/tun.ko fi Save the file with [escape] followed by the keys :wq! Mark the file as executable chmod +x /volume1/enable-tun.sh Now create a scheduled task to run this script on start-up: Log in to your Synology NAS drive web interface, go to Control Panel > Task Scheduler and create a new User-defined script as a Triggered Task . Name the task Enable TUN , set the user to be root and the event as Boot-up . Then, in the Task Settings tab enter bash /volume1/enable-tun.sh as the User-defined script and hit OK. To test if the script works, after restarting your NAS log back into SSH and run lsmod | grep -w tun to check that the TUN module was successfully re-loaded. 3. Install Docker The easiest way to install Docker on your Synology NAS drive is via the DSM package manager. Navigate to the Package Center and install Docker. 4. Download Enclave Using the search box on the Registry tab of the Docker package, search for enclave and download the enclavenetworks/enclave image from the container registry. The Enclave Docker image hosted on Docker hub . If you're prompted to choose a tag, select latest . 5. Launch an Enclave container Once the Enclave image is downloaded, the Launch button (shown below) in the Image tab will become available, click this. Now we are ready to setup the Enclave container. First, give the container a name, we've used enclave . Also need to be sure to check Execute container using high privilege , this causes DSM to pass the --privileged to Docker, which effectively enables the container to request --cap-add NET_ADMIN (Perform various network-related operations) and --device /dev/net/tun (Allows devices to run inside the container). Before clicking Next , open the Advanced Settings dialog. Under the Advanced Settings tab Select Enable auto-restart Under the Volume tab Select Add Folder . Create a mount path to /etc/enclave/profiles in the docker directory on your DiskStation. This is where Enclave will write its configuration file, private keys, and certificates to persist between reboots. Under the Network tab Select the checkbox to Use the same network as Docker host . This will allow you to access the Synology NAS drive via the Enclave network. Under the Environment tab Define a new Environment Variable called ENCLAVE_ENROLMENT_KEY and set its value to a valid (and enabled) enrolment key from your Enclave account. Be careful not to include whitespace! This Enrolment key is only used the first time Enclave runs. When Enclave has successfully started once and written a profile to disk, it is safe to remove this environment variable. Enrolment keys are available from the Enclave Portal and determine which systems can register to your Enclave account, so we recommend that you keep them secret . Leave the Execution Command set to the default value of run and click Apply. Congratulations! You've finished configuring your container, click Done to Launch. 6. Connect with Enclave Your Enclave container is starting up and will enrol to your account, within 1 or 2 seconds your Enclave container will be happily humming away in the background. Let's create a connection to another system running Enclave. From the Docker package, go to the Container tab, select the Enclave container you've just created and open the container Details pane. Here you can see CPU usage, RAM usage, container uptime and other information. Move to the Terminal tab and click on the Create button to drop into a bash shell inside the container, from here you can work with and manipulate Enclave as normal using the CLI. First, use the status verb to check on the Enclave process and view your container's Local Identity. The container will also be visible as a newly connected system in the Enclave Portal . # enclave status Now you know the Local Identity of your container, you can authorise other systems to talk to your container . Now you've added some connections, be sure to check the DNS forwarding is enabled on any peers which you're connected to so they can access your Synology NAS drive using a friendly DNS hostname like diskstation.enclave . Welcome to your own personal (dark) private network!

Synology are market leaders in network attached storage devices, perfect for home or small business use. Enclave helps you easily build safe, secure and private network connectivity without the hassle of configuring firewalls and VPNs, or needing to manage IP addresses, subnets, ACLs, NAT, routing tables, certificates and secret keys. In this article we will show you how to easily provide private remote access to your Synology NAS drive without needing to open ports or setup a VPN server, darkening your network to third parties by installing Enclave. Before you begin, you will need: An Enclave account (Register here , for free) A Synology NAS drive running at least DSM 7.0 (currently in Beta) Administrative access to your Synology NAS drive When setup, Enclave will be running inside a Docker container on your Synology NAS drive. At the time of writing, Docker can only be installed on devices from the Synology Plus Series product line (not the Value Series) so please check to see if your system is a supported model . The Synology NAS allows administrators to fully own their devices, enabling SSH and dropping into a root bash prompt on the DSM software, Synology's Linux-based operating system. Okay, lets get started. If you have opened administrative access ports on your Synology NAS drive to the public Internet (default ports are 5000, 5001 and 22 for SSH) you should re-consider if they really need to be open and close those ports if not. They are the default HTTP and HTTPS web server ports for Synology DSM and allow access to the administration console.","title":"How to securely access your Synology NAS drive with Enclave"},{"location":"tutorials/how-to-securely-access-your-synology-nas-drive-with-enclave/#1-enable-ssh-access","text":"First, you'll need to enable SSH access to your Synology NAS drive.

If you're running Enclave on your Synology NAS using Docker, at some point you'll almost certainly want to update to the latest version of Enclave. This tutorial shows you how to upgrade your existing Docker container to run the latest version of Enclave without losing your enrolment certificate or Enclave system identity. 1. Stop the Enclave container First, let's stop your existing Enclave container. Note: If you're accessing the Synology NAS drive using an Enclave connection, stopping the container will disconnect you. Make sure you have an alternative route to access the NAS when updating Enclave. The easiest way to stop the Enclave container on your Synology NAS drive is via the Docker app. Log into the Synology NAS drive web interface, navigate to the Main Menu and launch the Docker app. Go to the Container section, find the enclave container, and select Action > Stop . 2. Download the latest image Next, using the search box on the Registry tab of the Docker app, search for the enclavenetworks/enclave image and download it from the container registry. If you're prompted to choose a tag, select latest . You may be interested to know that the Enclave images are hosted here on the Docker hub website. 3. Wait for docker pull Your Synology NAS is performing a docker pull in the background, wait for a system notification to let you know that this operation has completed successfully. 4. Create a new Enclave container You'll need to create a new container to use the latest Enclave image, but not from scratch. You can take a short-cut here by duplicating the settings from your existing Enclave container to create a new one. Navigate to the Container section of the Docker app, select the enclave container and then go to Settings > Duplicate . We suggest temporarily naming your the new container enclave-copy . Click Apply to create it. 5. Remove the original container You don't need the original container anymore. Select the older enclave container and go to Action > Delete . You'll be reminded that deleting this container mean its data will be lost. The enrolled Enclave identity is stored in a Docker Volume which won't be affected by deleting the container, so it's safe to delete the original container. Click Delete to confirm. 6. Rename and Launch Now you have a new container called enclave-copy . If you wish you can rename the container; now is a good time to do so \u2014 select it, click Edit and change the container name to enclave . All done.

Install Open the download page section of your account in the Enclave Portal and copy the download link to the setup script for your Raspberry Pi and run it on your device. 2. Enrol Open the Portal and provision a new enrolment key for your Raspberry Pi if you need to. Alternatively, if an existing enrolment is available, make note of the enrolment key and use that to enrol the device. Enrol the device. If you don't supply the enrolment key at the command line, Enclave will prompt you to enter the enrolment key. $ sudo enclave enrol 3. Start Start Enclave on the Raspberry Pi $ sudo systemctl start enclave 4. Connect Using Enclave Core, you must authorise a connection to other systems in order to build network connectivity. You will need to know the certificate name of each counterpart system. In this example I will connect the Raspberry Pi to my office workstation so I can view its Motion camera feed remotely. My workstation's certificate name is 72LVG and on the Raspberry Pi I will authorise Enclave to allow connections with my workstation using the add command. The -d argument is a description (or friendly name) of this connection for future reference. $ enclave add 72LVG The workstation will need to mutually authorise the Raspberry Pi connection aswell, and so the workstation needs to know the certificate name of the Raspberry Pi. Run enclave status on the Raspberry Pi to find its local certificate name. 5. Verify You can find your Raspberry Pi's new Enclave IP address and connectivity to other peers by: Checking the Portal Running ifconfig tap0 Running enclave status Having problems?
