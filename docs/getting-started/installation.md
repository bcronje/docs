# Getting Started — Installation

In this quick start guide we will start your journey with Enclave by showing you how to enrol your first systems and use policy and tags to establish a private network between them.

![Quick start steps](/images/quick-start/steps.png)

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you will need:

1. An Enclave account, it's [free to register](https://portal.enclave.io/account/register)
2. At least two computers, devices or containers where you can install software

## Get an Enrolment Key

You will need an Enrolment Key from your account to install Enclave. Enrolment Keys allow you to enrol new systems or devices to your Enclave account.

1. Login to your account in the [Enclave Portal](https://portal.enclave.io/)
2. Navigate to the Enrolment Keys page and select the [`Default Enrolment Key`](https://portal.enclave.io/my/keys) from the table
3. In the details pane, select [`View key`](https://portal.enclave.io/my/keys/1) and make a note of the 30 character Enrolment Key

> **Security note:** Enrolment keys should be treated as secrets; handle, share and store your Enrolment Keys as you would any other organisational secret.

<!-- -->

> **Production use:** This guide uses a `Default Enrolment Key` which was automatically created when you first registered for an account. You can (and should) create your own Enrolment Keys for use in production. Visit the [Enrolment Keys](/management/enrolment) section of the handbook to learn more about creating and managing Enrolment Keys.

=== "Containers"

    Select your platform:

    === "Docker"

        1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

            ```yaml
            version: '3.1'

            services:
              enclave-fabric:
                container_name: fabric
                image: enclavenetworks/enclave:latest
                restart: always

                cap_add:
                  - NET_ADMIN
                devices:
                  - /dev/net/tun
                environment:
                  ENCLAVE_ENROLMENT_KEY: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
                volumes:
                  - enclave-config:/etc/enclave/profiles
                  - enclave-logs:/var/log/enclave

            volumes:
              enclave-config:
              enclave-logs:
            ```

        2. Replace `XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX` with your `Default Enrolment Key`

        3. Bring the container up using `docker-compose up -d`

        4. Verify Enclave is running insider the container with `docker exec fabric enclave status`

    === "Kubernetes"

        1. Add the **enclave-sidecar** to your pod yaml file under the `containers:` section. For example, if your pod contains an nginx container:

            ```yaml
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: nginx-container
                image: nginx:1.7.9
                ports:
                  - containerPort: 80
            ```

             Add the **enclave-sidecar** definition to below your existing pod:

            ```yaml
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: nginx-container
                ...
                
              - name: enclave-sidecar
                image: enclavenetworks/enclave:latest
                env:
                  - name: "ENCLAVE_ENROLMENT_KEY"
                    value: "XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX"
                securityContext:
                  capabilities:
                    add: ['NET_ADMIN']
                volumeMounts:
                  - name: tun
                    mountPath: /dev/net/tun
              volumes:
                - name: tun
                  hostPath:
                    type: 'CharDevice'
                    path: /dev/net/tun
            ```

            > See [pod.yaml](https://github.com/enclave-networks/kubernetes/blob/main/examples/nginx-enclave-sidecar/pod.yaml) for a complete example. 

        2. Replace `XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX` with your `Default Enrolment Key`

        3. Push your changes to the cluster using `kubectl apply` or your preferred method

=== "Network Attached Storage"

    Select your device:

    === "Synology NAS"

        1. We have beta support for Synology NAS drives (running on DSM 7.0 or later) via docker. Please follow our guide to [installing Enclave on your Synology NAS drive](/tutorials/how-to-securely-access-your-synology-nas-drive-with-enclave/).

**Congratulations!** You've successfully enrolled a new system to your Enclave account. Once you've enrolled at least two systems, continue by [attaching tags](/getting-started/attach-tags) to your newly enrolled systems.
