# Attach Tags

**Tags** are free-form text labels which can be attached to one or more systems in your account. Tags allow administrators to group systems with similar characteristics together. Tags can be manually added to an enrolled system, or an Enrolment Key can be configured to apply an initial set of tags to enrolling systems.

The following graphic illustrates how a single tag might apply to several individual systems, in this example systems called `gitlab`, `teamcity` and a third system called `repo` are all members of the tag `org.build.ci-cd`.

/ **Production use:** This guide uses a `org.quickstart` tag. You can (and should) create your own Tags for use in production. To learn more about how to create and manage Tags in your organisation, please refer to the [Policy and Tags](/handbook/tags-and-policies.md) section of this handbook. 

1. In the Portal, navigate to the **Systems** page and confirm both systems enrolled in step 2 of this guide are shown as connected.
2. Select the **first** system you enrolled to open the details pane and use the pencil icon (top-right of the pane) to enter Edit mode.
3. Give your first system a recognisable description (_e.g. Jane's Laptop_) and in the tags section type `org.quickstart` and press Enter. Click Save and close the details pane.
4. Select the **second** system you enrolled to open the details pane and use the pencil icon (top-right of the pane) to enter Edit mode.
5. Give your second system a recognisable description (_e.g. Test Server_) and in the tags section type `org.quickstart` again. Press Enter, click Save and close the details pane.
