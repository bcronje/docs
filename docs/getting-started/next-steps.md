## Find your Enclave IP address

Each system (or device) running Enclave is automatically assigned an IP address from the default range 100.64.0.0/10. [Learn more](/networking/ip-addresses).

In order to send data to other systems in your Enclave you will need to know the IP address of your peers, and they will need to know yours. 

=== "Windows Tray"

    Open Enclave by double clicking on the <img src="/assets/favicon.ico" alt="drawing" width="18" style="vertical-align: middle;" /> icon in the Windows tray notification area, or find `Enclave` in the Start Menu.

=== "Linux or Command Line"

    Run `enclave status` from a command prompt or terminal. In this example, the local Enclave IP address is the value of `Virtual address` under our `Local identity`, in this case 100.106.103.219.

    ```
    $ enclave status

    Local identity: V88R

        Certificate . . . . : CN=PL8 Expires=Never (Perpetual Issue)
        Endpoint. . . . . . : Tcp/134.122.110.217:443 (via relay)
        MAC address . . . . : CE-37-47-5F-4D-BE (fake arp)

        Virtual address . . : 100.81.14.231
        Dns . . . . . . . . : pl8.enclave, gitlab.enclave
    ```

    From the CLI output, you can see that this system also has a connection to another peer, a Gitlab server. This `Virtual address` for this system is also reported, in this case `100.81.14.231`.

## Find your Enclave DNS hostname

Enclave has a built-in DNS resolver. Right click on any connected system (e.g. Gitlab) in the Windows Tray application and select `Copy` > `Hostname`. Alternatively consult the output of `enclave status` to see the `Dns` names available for each connected peer. On Windows, DNS lookups are automatically configured, so in this example given where we're connected to a GitLab server we could `ping gitlab.enclave` or load https://gitlab.enclave in a browser.

On Linux, administrators must manually configure the operating system to use the Enclave DNS resolver â€” see [how to configure DNS forwarding on Linux](/kb/how-to-configure-dns-forwarding-on-linux).

Visit the [DNS section](/networking/dns) to learn how to use the built-in name resolution services inside your Enclave network.

## Test connectivity

Now that we know the IP address of one of our connected peers (in this example, `100.81.14.231` is the IP address of a connected Gitlab server and `gitlab.enclave` its hostname) let's test connectivity. Pings are a great start, but don't forget to check the host local Windows or Linux firewalls on the destination system to ensure ICMP traffic is permitted.

```
C:\> ping gitlab.enclave
