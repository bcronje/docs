# Get an Enrolment Key

**Enrolment Keys** allow new systems or devices to join your Enclave account. Enrolment Keys can also used to apply initial configuration settings (such as [Policy and Tags](handbook/policies-and-tags.md)) to new systems as they enrol.

1. Login to your account in the [Enclave Portal](https://portal.enclave.io/).
2. Navigate to the [Enrolment Keys](https://portal.enclave.io/my/keys) page and select the `Default Enrolment Key` from the table. In the details pane, select `View key` and make a note of the 30 character Enrolment Key as you will need it to install Enclave.

> **Security note:** Enrolment keys should be treated as secrets; Handle, share and store your Enrolment Keys as you would any other organisational secret.

> **Production use:** This guide uses a `Default Enrolment Key` which was automatically created when you registered for an account. You can (and should) create your own Enrolment Keys for use in production. Visit the [Enrolment Keys](/handbook/enrolment.md) section of the handbook to learn more about creating and managing Enrolment Keys.
