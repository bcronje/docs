# Get an Enrolment Key

Enrolment Keys allow new systems and devices to join your account. Enrolment Keys are also used to apply initial configuration settings (such as [Policy and Tags](handbook/tags-and-policies.md)) to new systems as they enrol.

This guide uses a `Default Enrolment Key` which was automatically created when you registered for an account. You can (and should) create your own Enrolment Keys for use in production. Visit the [Enrolment Keys](/handbook/enrolment.md) section of the handbook to learn more about creating and managing Enrolment Keys.

1. Login to your account in the [Enclave Portal](https://portal.enclave.io/my/new-system).
2. Navigate to the **Enrol a new system** page and select the `Default Enrolment Key` from the drop down list. Make a note of the 30 character enrolment key as you will need it to install Enclave.

/ **Security note:** Enrolment keys should be treated as secrets; Handle, share and store your Enrolment Keys as you would any other organisational secret.
