=== "Synology NAS"

    1. We have beta support for Synology NAS drives (running on DSM 7.0 or later) via docker. Please follow our guide to [installing Enclave on your Synology NAS drive](/tutorials/how-to-securely-access-your-synology-nas-drive-with-enclave/).

## What to do if the install fails

If an install goes horribly wrong or is interrupted, try re-running the Enclave `setup.sh` script to restart the process. If your installation fails and you are unable to resolve the problem by retrying, please contact <a href="mailto:support@enclave.io">support@enclave.io</a>.
