        curl -fsSL https://packages.enclave.io/apt/enclave.stable.gpg  | sudo apt-key add -
        curl -fsSL https://packages.enclave.io/apt/enclave.stable.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/enclave.list
        sudo apt-get update

3. Install Enclave.

## Starting and stopping Enclave

The Enclave installer creates a lightweight supervisor service set to run at system start which is responsible for starting the Enclave fabric. The supervisor service exists to start, stop and restart Enclave fabric in the background as daemon child processes.

The supervisor service responds to the Enclave CLI verbs [start](/cli/start) and [stop](/cli/stop) to control the Fabric.

## Updating Enclave

Enclave is updated using the standard apt package manager commands `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade`.

## Uninstalling Enclave

**TODO** `apt-get remove` and `apt-get purge`

> **Note:** Enclave does not backup a system's private keys. Lost or deleted private keys are not recoverable. If a system's configuration and private keys are lost, to use that system with Enclave again it must be re-enrolled.

## What to do if the install fails
