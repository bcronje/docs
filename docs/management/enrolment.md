Enrolment keys allows trusted parties to enrol new systems or devices to your Enclave account.

## Approval modes

Enrolment keys are either configured for automatic enrolment or manual enrolment.

Depending on the type of enrolment key you used to enrol your new system, it might be held waiting for an Administrator to provide enrolment approval in your account [Portal](https://portal.enclave.io/). 

### Manual enrolment

Manual approval enrolment keys place newly on-boarded systems into a gated state, isolated from your wider account and remain disabled from your wider account until approval is granted by an Administrator. To provide approval, account administrators must visit the [unapproved systems](https://portal.enclave.io/my/unapproved-systems) page in the Portal and select the unapproved systems and click approve.

### Automatic enrolment

Automatic approval enrolment keys are special purpose keys that allow systems to automatically enrol without Administrator approval. Automatic approval should only be used in trusted scenarios such as Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Auto tagging

Enrolment Keys can also used to apply initial configuration settings (such as [Tags](/management/tags)) to new systems as they enrol.
